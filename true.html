            <h3>Is it possible to use content I have downloaded for future projects for clients?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, it is possible. If you become an Up Premium User, all of the content you are downloading automatically comes with a commercial license.
              <br><br>
              However, if you remain an Up Free User, you need to make sure you are purchasing/downloading the content with the commercial license option. Read more on <a href="store/license">our license options here</a>.
